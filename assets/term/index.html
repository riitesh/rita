        <br>
        Visitors and users of the website are referred to individually as "user" and collectively as “users”.
        <br><br>
        By registering for, accessing, browsing, or using the website, the user acknowledges that they have read,
        understood and agreed to be bound by the following terms and conditions, including any additional guidelines (as
        defined below) and future modifications (collectively, the "terms"). Please read carefully the following terms
        of service:
        <br><br>
        <b>A.</b>  If the user is a parent or guardian, providing consent for their child to Any user, under the age of 13, whose
        registration has not been register with the website, then the user agrees to be bound by these terms of service
        in respect of the child's use of the website.
        <br><br>
       <b>B.</b> The website is not available to <br>
            a.  Any user previously suspended or removed from the website by trinaytra, or <br>
            b.  approved by a legal parent or guardian. By checking the ‘I agree’ option, or by using or registering for an
        account on www.trinaytra.com, the user represents that they have not been suspended or removed previously from
        the website by trinaytra, and that they are either at least 13 years of age or a parent and/or guardian has
        consented to them using a trinaytra account  <br> <br>
        <b>C.</b>   In order to use certain features of the website, the user must register for an account. The user has to generate
        a password in connection with the account.

        The users are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their accounts and other credentials.
        The user agrees to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under their account.
        The user agrees that the personal information provided to trinaytra during registration, or any other activity,
        is true, accurate, current, and complete. The user also agrees that they will ensure that this information is
        kept accurate and up-to-date at all times. If the user has a reason to believe that their account is no longer
        secure (e.g., in the event of a loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure or use of account ID, password), then
        the user agrees to immediately notify trinaytra. The user will be liable for the losses incurred by trinaytra or
        others due to any unauthorized use of the user’s account. <br> <br>
       <b>D.</b>   If the user is a child [under the age of 13 years], then registration for an account will be subject to the
        parent’s and/or guardian’s consent. Such users cannot register an account with trinaytra without consent and
        approval of a parent or legal guardian. A child member can start the registration process, but for verification
        of an account, parental consent is mandatory. <br><br>
        Notwithstanding, a child member may use the website if the registration is done through an educational
        organization that has entered into a direct partnership with trinaytra, through which the educational
        organization has consented to allow the child to use the website. A child member, who has registered through
        such external educational organizations, will only be permitted to use the website for so long as trinaytra
        reasonably believes that such access has been consented by the child member's parent or guardian. <br> <br>

        approve, or manage a child member account for any user other than the parent member’s own children. A parent
        member account, along with all associated child member accounts, may be terminated by trinaytra at any time and
        without warning for any failure to abide by these terms. If a Parent member provides consent for registration of
        any child member, then the parent member agrees and acknowledges that they are the child member’s legal parent
        or guardian, and agrees to be bound by the terms on behalf of such child member, including without limitation
        being liable for all use of the website by the child member. The parent member acknowledges that trinaytra can
        choose, but is not obligated, to make any inquiries, either directly or through third parties, that trinaytra
        deems necessary to validate the parent member’s registration information, including, without limitation,
        engaging third parties to provide verification services. Trinaytra reserves all rights to take legal actions
        against anyone who misrepresents personal information, or is otherwise untruthful about their identity.

        information submitted by any user, and trinaytra is not obligated to verify the identity of any user, including
        any user’s claim to be a parent member. <br><br>
